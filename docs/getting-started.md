## What is EasyCLA?

>>>>>>> cc1c7521eaa41cc30bed794caa14c3f283d54f09
**EasyCLA** helps maintainers of open source projects to streamline their workflows and reduce the hassle of managing Contributor License Agreements (CLAs) and authorizing contributors. 

By automating many of the manual processes, this open source solution hosted by the Linux Foundation reduces delays for developers to get authorized under a CLA.

* [Contributor](#contributor)

How you interact with EasyCLA depends on your role.

#### Project Manager


>>>>>>> cc1c7521eaa41cc30bed794caa14c3f283d54f09
You are a Project Manager if you are the project maintainer responsible for selecting the appropriate Individual and Corporate CLA.  

Traditionally, the Project Manager has had to enforce whether a contributor was authorized to commit code to their project at every commit.  This would become especially cumbersome when getting signatures for Corporate CLAs from companies and updating each company’s whitelist of authorized developers.

With EasyCLA, your most common tasks will be:

* Select a CLA
* Select the projects

Within EasyCLA, you are most likely to:

* Receive an email asking you to sign the CLA
* Provide an electronic signature
